Customizing the Toast 
For this challenge, customize the toast to show at the top instead of the bottom of the screen.
To change how the toast is displayed, use the Toast classâ€™s setGravity function. Use Gravity.TOP for the gravity value. 
Refer to the developer documentation at developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/widget/Toast#setgravity for more details.

As it said in Android documentation about Toast setGravity method, this method doesn't work anymore for devices
running API30 or higher.
